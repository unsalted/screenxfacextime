A javascript/jquery run site that organizes 7000 screenshots over 5 days.

I used exiftool to create a json directory of images, find the shell script in: `genjson.sh`

The apple script and shell script that collected images can be found in: `/capture-scripts/`

There is currently a very slow example running at: http://screenxfacextime-mdptests.rhcloud.com/

This really should have been programmed primarily in php... oh well next time.
